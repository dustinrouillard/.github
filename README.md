#### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

The name's Dustin, I'm 20 years old, currently living in Vancouver, Canada, and I'm the CTO & Co-Founder of [**Notify Technology, Inc.**](https://notify.me) 

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer who is obsessed with scalable infrastructure, kubernetes is a serious part of my life now.

I'm the Full-Time CTO and Systems Administrator at [**Notify**](https://notify.me), but in my spare time I write a lot of code for personal projects such as the api that updates the table below, and I also do things for [**Hiven**](https://hiven.io) when I'm needed.
